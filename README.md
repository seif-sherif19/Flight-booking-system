this file contains my C++ program to create a flight booking system using the principles of object oriented programming suac as : inheritance, polymorphism, creating classes and constuctors.
The program has 5 classes (person, passenger, pilot details, flight details and extra flight details) . 
These five classes help you to adjust your flight comfortably 
such as choosing your seat, choosing your preferred meal on the plane, and choosing whether you want to board pets with you or not.
